For an added challenge:
	+ try incorporating some ES6 syntax into your solutions.


[DONE] + Create an index.html file 
[DONE]+ add <script> tags for your JavaScript to complete the following exercises:

	[DONE] + Go through each value in the array x, where x = [3,5,‘Dojo’, ‘rocks’, ‘Michael’, ‘Sensei’]. Log each value.

	[DONE] + Add a new value (100) in the array x using a push method.

	[DONE] + Add a new array ["hello", "world", "JavaScript is Fun"] to variable x. 

	[DONE] + Log x in the console and analyze how x looks now.

	[DONE] + Create a simple for loop that sums all the numbers between 1 to 500. Have console log the final sum.

	[DONE] + Write a loop that will go through the array [1, 5, 90, 25, -3, 0], find the minimum value, and then print it

	[DONE] + Write a loop that will go through the array [1, 5, 90, 25, -3, 0], find the average of all of the values, and then print it

[DONE] + Move the code from inside the <script> tag into a main.js file. 
[DONE] + In the index.html change the <script> tag to: <script src = 'main.js'> 
[DONE] + Reload the index.html and open up the console on your browser.

Next:
[DONE] + Open your terminal (we switch from client side to ‘server side’ here!)
[DONE] + navigate to the folder with main.js folder and run nodemon main.js. 
[DONE] + Write a for-in loop that will navigate through the object below (or write your own object):

var new_ninja = {
 name: 'Jessica',
 profession: 'coder',
 favorite_language: 'JavaScript', //like that's even a question!
 dojo: 'Dallas'
}


And console.log() each key value pair.
