# Note:

Due to the new pokemon API version 2 that came out, the structure of this JS program no longer retrieves the appropriate images. I'll have to go through and study the new API (of which now pokemon href/src images are no longer contained within the API data, but a second-level link is given to retrieve the image for a new web host). This is a cool little program, and was a lot of learning and fun to make, but it is such a small-level thing I may or may not have the time to come back and update the structure to the new API. We'll see though...alas I apologize for the inconvenience.
