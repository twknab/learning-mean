JS Fundamentals 2 Assignment, To Do:


Turn problems from part 1 into functions which take inputs:
	+ write the following functions as ANONYMOUS functions, assigned to variables:
		//DONE + create a simple loop that sums all integers between x and y (inclusive). console log the sum. (//DONEmake sure number)
		//DONE + write a loop that will go through an array, find the minimum value and then return it //DONE(make sure array)
		//DONE + write a loop that will go through an array, find the average of all values, then return it //DONE(make sure array)


//DONE Rewrite the above 3 as a method of an object.


//DONE Create a JS object with these properties/methods:
	
	//DONE Properties:
		//DONE + name - set this as your name
		//DONE + distanceTraveled -  set this initially to 0

	//DONE Methods:
		//DONE + remember, methods should return themselves (right?)
		//DONE + sayName - should alert the objects name propery (must use index.html for alert)
		//DONE + saySomething = have it accept a parameter, this function should then say for example, '<name> says: <string parameter>' (make sure string)
		//DONE + walk - alert, '<name> is walking...' and increase distanceTraveled by 3
		//DONE + run - '<name> is running...' and increase distanceTraveled by 10
		//DONE + crawl - '<name> is crawling...' and increase distanceTraveled by 1
