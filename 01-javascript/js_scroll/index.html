		bug1: changed if statement below so if character count == word[word_counter].length +1 (added the plus one so all characters display)

		bug2: poor-spacing momentum (hanging). i had to examine the answer key for this one (very tricky). what we had to do here, was inside the function, we created a new variable called 'character'. We set this variable to be 'words[word_counter][character_counter++]'. We then use an IF statement to evaluate if any of the character values is a ' '(space). If so, we replace the space with a '&nbsp;'

			(note, I was trying (but failing) to somehow add the nbsp; in between each word of the sentence (was looking around for JS functions), but we can do this ourselves as the example below showscases)

				character_counter = 0;	//start over with the first character of the word
