# About

This folder contains a bunch of different projects that are mostly pertaining to introduction to JavaScript and JS basics. All folders are some project or another, however they are not ordered by complexity in subject matter, so you may have to explore around a bit.

Note: All assignments here were originally written prior to the release of ES6. Therefor, variable declaration is only made by the use of `var`, and does not contain any of the ES6 variations for various scopes. There are a few bits and pieces sprinkled in about ES6, but I'll likely come back and add additional projects at a later time that practice using some of the new sweetened syntax. 

In addition to exploring the projects contained herein, please also see the other sections in the root directory in which this `01-javascript` folder lies. More information, projects and assignments utilizing node, express, mongo, angular and the full MEAN stack can be found there.
