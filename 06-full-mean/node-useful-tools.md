Checkout this sweet package for node which gives you console logs of route activity, similar to what you've seen in debuggers like Django. This is very helpful for developing your API, by giving you more information in your system console regarding route requests.

Read more here, or see `./node-token-authentication` for it in action (see `package.json` inside of that project).
