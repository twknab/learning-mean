/*

	Mongoose has a built-in way to handle validations.
	When you setup your model, you can add things like 'required' (see previous assignments in the Mongoose folder) to input fields.

	To capture the 'error message' generated by Mongoose, we have to pass in the parameter  of 'err' as the FIRST parameter, which
	Mongoose will automatically return our errors within.

*/
	// Usually the error data is in the following format:

	err = {
      errors:
          {
          schemaInThing_that_had_error:
              {
                message:"some string of errors",
                kind:"what didn't work",
                path:"reference to the schema's name",
                value:"cause of the initial error"


              }
          },
      name: "Validation error"
      }
