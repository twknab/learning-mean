		// This code creates a new controller:
		app.controller('PlayersController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
			//javascript that controls the Player view goes here:
		}]);

		// If we want access to other Angular objects, all we do is inject other objects from the app in!
		app.controller('PlayersController', ['$scope', 'newinjectable', function($scope, "custom name of new injectable") {
			//javascript that controls the Player view goes here:
		}]);
		/*
			Now our PlayersController has access to $scope and newinjectable. To use the methods and properties of $scope, we’ll access them using $scope.method or property. To access newinjectable, which could be a factory, we’ll access it by whatever custom name we gave it and its properties by using a period(.). For Example, the newinjectable custom name is UserFactory, we can do something like UserFactory.addNewUser().

			Similarly to our controller example, many of our factories are injected with the $http service object. This object makes our AJAX calls to the DB. Similar to jQuery $.get, $.ajax, $.post methods.
